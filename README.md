# Café Map
An interactive map of my favourite cafés with contextual information. I created this project mainly to freshen up my JavaScript (JS) skills for interactive mapping and because I am passionate about local cafés, bakeries and coffee. The project is written in plain JS and utilizes an SQLite database such that it can be hosted on GitHub Pages.
